## Phase 1 — Authentication — Slice 1 (core email/password + sessions) — 2026-06-27

First implementation code (R1 approval gate cleared). Monorepo toolchain + core auth vertical; **build / lint / typecheck / test all green (21 tests)**.

- [x] Monorepo build online: pnpm 9 + Turborepo (`build`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`test`).
- [x] `packages/types` — shared auth contracts + enums.
- [x] `packages/database` — Prisma (Mongo) auth subset: `User`, `Session` + embedded types ([docs/DATABASE.md](../docs/DATABASE.md)).
- [x] `apps/server` NestJS — zod config, `PrismaModule`, `/api/healthz`, URI versioning, `ValidationPipe`, canon §10 error envelope.
- [x] Auth core — argon2id hashing; RS256 access JWT + opaque rotating refresh (reuse detection → family revoke); device `Session`s.
- [x] Auth REST — `register`/`login`/`refresh`/`logout`/`me`; httpOnly refresh cookie; `JwtAuthGuard` + `@CurrentUser`.
- [x] Tests — 21 passing (unit + e2e via in-memory Prisma double).
- [ ] Deferred to Slice 2: OAuth, guest, email verify, password reset, TOTP 2FA, session endpoints, real ESLint, real-Mongo integration, 90% coverage.

> Recorded per R3/R4 in [history/decision-ledger.md](../history/decision-ledger.md) (Implementation decisions, IMPL-001..004). Repomix regeneration is now applicable (first code landed) — tracked as a Slice-2 follow-up.

## Phase 0 — Open-Questions Remediation — 2026-06-27

Cleared the Phase-0 open-questions punch-list under the Chief Architect's binding resolutions
([open-questions.md](./open-questions.md)). Planning only — no application code (R1). Recorded
per R3/R4 in [history/decision-ledger.md](../history/decision-ledger.md) (2026-06-27 remediation
section) and [history/migrations.md](../history/migrations.md).

- [x] Backfilled [ADR-009 — MinIO object storage](../adr/ADR-009-minio-storage.md) and [ADR-010 — Docker-first delivery](../adr/ADR-010-docker-first.md) to ratify existing canon (no decision change) — B1.
- [x] Authored [ADR-011 — Realtime backplane (Redis pub/sub + Streams)](../adr/ADR-011-realtime-backplane.md); ledger row **D-011** added — B2.
- [x] Ledger canon-amendment rows for new collections `room_bans`, `join_requests`, `activity_events` (and confirmation of `role_assignments`, `votes`) — B3/B4.
- [x] Ledger canon-amendment row for realtime event `room:member:update` (S→C) — B5.
- [x] Ledger canon-amendment row for per-room field `playlistAuthority` (DB rename `syncAuthorityPlaylist` → `playlistAuthority`) — B6.
- [x] Lesson [L-003](../history/lessons-learned.md) recorded on the parallel-authoring Open-Questions discipline.
- [x] Process-discipline ADR renumbered to **ADR-012 / D-012** (Deferred-to-Phase-1) — PROC-1.
- [x] Repomix regeneration noted as **deferred — pending first code** (PROC-3); not run.
